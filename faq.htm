                <h2>WHAT ABOUT IF I HAVE ALLERGIES?</h2>
                <p>If you have an allergy or intolerance, please let us know by emailing us at xxyz@hotmail.com with your order number. We will add a note to your account and substitute the items with more of another item in your box.</p>

                <h2>WHAT ABOUT THE PACKAGING?</h2>
                <p>We started Veg To Your Door with the idea that our boxes could provide a safe and environmentally-friendly way for families to ensure they all get their 5-a-day. With every box we pack, we try to reduce the materials we use as much as possible. Some items must be kept in the packaging to reduce bruising of the produce in transit, however, we will keep reviewing the situation to ensure as little waste as possible. 
                    Of course, at the moment, we are avoiding recycling boxes due to COVID-19, however, in the future we hope to be able to reach a point where even the boxes we use can be recycled for future use. In the meantime, they make a great playhouse for your children/pets!
                </p>

                <h2>CAN I USE APPLE PAY/GOOGLE PAY?</h2>
                <p>Yes! If you prefer the swift checkout, you can order a box at the touch of a button. Please be aware that you are unable to select a delivery day with this option and you will automatically be put in for the earliest available Saturday.
