                <h2>Who We Are?</h2>
                <p>We are VEG TO YOUR DOOR â€“ a local fruit and veg delivery company that specialise in supplying top quality produce both wholesale and to our loyal customers at home. We are a small, family run business and are just two people with over 10 years of experience in greengrocery.
                    We go to New Spitalfields Market 6 days a week to purchase top quality produce for our customers and clients. Before purchasing, everything undergoes a taste test and is mindfully selected for you. Once everything is rounded up, we drive over to our warehouse which is used solely for VEG TO YOUR DOOR, and we pack the boxes for our customers, and prepare the orders for our bus
                </p>

                <h2>What We Offer?</h2>
                <p>We offer a tailor-made service for you, procuring the best quality produce that you require. We guarantee NEXT DAY DELIVERY and just ask that orders are in by 6pm the evening before you would like delivery. We can purchase all produce that you need upon your request (providing items are in season) and can deliver directly to your address. 
                    We use only the best quality produce which is superior in comparison to supermarket items. We can also provide prepped produce (pre-peeled and chopped) dairy products, eggs, bread and more.
                </p>

                <h2>Whom We Supply?</h2>
                <p>We supply schools, nurseries, restaurants, cafes, and customers at home with fresh fruit and veg 6 days a week and we go to New Spitalfields Market Monday-Saturday.
